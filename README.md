# TensorLab
Cloud Machine Learning Platform based on TensorLayer

## Why TensorLab

At NIPS 2016, Andrew Ng say that every machine learning research group must be equiped with data warehouse technology. 
The TensorLayer system is designed for both academic research and also for production.
For production application, TensorLab is designed as a cloud based platform to streamline the deep learning model development process.
The orignal motivation is to enable all the researchers from Imperial College London have access to deep learning technology without extensive deep learning knowlege.
