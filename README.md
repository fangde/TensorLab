## Why TensorLab

In his NIPS 2016 talk, Andrew Ng mentioned that all the AI research group should be equipped with some data warehouse technology.   
TensorLab started during the process of developing the TensorLayer system, with a focus on data managment aspect of AI development. The original motivation is Prof Yike Guoâ€™s vision that democratise the deep learning technology the engineering and scientiests who are domain expert but not necessary deep learning gurus.
TensorLayer project created by Dr Hao Dong is great success which greatly simplify developing machine learning model. 
However, according to our experience, we still find researchers struggling mastering the deep learning technology, the management of models and data is becoming another big hurdles facing many deep learning learning.  
TensorLab is started with the vision to build an autonmous system to streamline the whole model development process. 
More specifically, we are targeting at the following questions.


1. How to manage training data. Deep learning sometime requires GB, TB or PB data, the first challenge is finding the training data from the enterpertise dataware house

2.  How to load the training data which is 100 times bigger than the computer node hard-drive

3. Model Managment, which includes model version, model mining and monitoring the training process of a fleet of models, like 100

4. How to streamline the whole process of training, validating and deployment
